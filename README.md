# PythonForEverybody
**Goals** </br>
(high level intended outcomes; for software, a Product Backlog)</br>
**Boundaries / Scope** </br>
(where the functions and responsibilities of the solution start and end / what it should do and what is left to other systems to do)</br>
**Success criteria** </br>
(set of conditions to be satisfied at completion; must be measurable and verifiable, like a test)</br>
**Constraints**</br>
(externally imposed limitations on system requirements, design, or implementation or on the process used to develop or modify a system)</br>
**Assumptions**</br>
(things that are accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof)</br>
**Stakeholders** </br>
(individuals or organizations having a right, share, claim, or interest in a system or in its possession of characteristics that meet their needs and expectations)</br>
**Timelines** </br>
(for software, a breakdown of high level goals like from the Product Backlog into time-bound smaller, more detailed tasks, like in Sprint Backlogs)</br>
